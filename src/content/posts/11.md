# Software Testing Overview

## What is Software Testing?
**Software Testing** is the process of evaluating a software application to detect and resolve defects. It ensures that the software meets business and technical requirements and functions as expected.

### Objectives of Software Testing:
- Identify and fix software defects.
- Ensure software **quality, reliability, and security**.
- Validate that the product meets customer requirements.
- Improve overall **performance and user experience**.

### Importance of Software Testing:
- Prevents **high-cost failures** in production.
- Ensures **compatibility** across different environments.
- Enhances **customer satisfaction** and business reputation.

## Common Types of Software Testing

| **Type**         | **Description** |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **Unit Testing** | Tests individual components or functions of code. |
| **Integration Testing** | Ensures multiple components work together correctly. |
| **Regression Testing** | Confirms new code changes don’t break existing features. |
| **System Testing** | End-to-end testing to validate the entire application. |
| **Smoke Testing** | A quick validation of basic functionality before deeper testing. |
| **Performance Testing** | Assesses response time, speed, and scalability. |
| **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** | Ensures the software meets customer expectations before release. |
| **Stress Testing** | Evaluates how the system handles high loads or extreme conditions. |
| **Sanity Testing** | Verifies bug fixes and changes after a build. |

# Software Testing Q&A

1. **What is software testing?**  
   - Software testing involves evaluating and verifying a software product’s functionality to ensure it meets requirements and is defect-free.

2. **What are the different types of software testing?**  
   - **Functional Testing**: Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, regression testing, user acceptance testing.  
   - **Non-Functional Testing**: Performance testing, security testing, documentation testing, installation testing.

3. **What are the principles of testing?**  
   - **Absence of errors fallacy**: Bug-free software must still meet customer needs.  
   - **Testing shows the presence of errors**: Testing reduces, but doesn’t eliminate, defects.  
   - **Exhaustive testing is not possible**: It’s impractical to test all possible cases.  
   - **Defect clustering**: Most defects are found in a small number of modules.  
   - **Pesticide paradox**: Re-running the same tests won’t find new bugs; test cases need updates.  
   - **Early testing**: Catching defects early reduces costs.  
   - **Testing is context-dependent**: Testing strategies vary by project.

4. **What is API testing?**  
   - API testing verifies interactions between different software components by testing their requests, responses, and error handling.

5. **How does a test coverage tool work?**  
   - It measures how much of the codebase is executed during testing to ensure adequate coverage.

6. **What are the different types of test coverage techniques?**  
   - **Statement Coverage**  
   - **Decision Coverage**  
   - **Path Coverage**  
   - **Function Coverage**  

7. **What is black-box, white-box, and grey-box testing?**  
   - **Black-box testing**: Tests external behavior without knowing internal code structure.  
   - **White-box testing**: Tests internal logic, focusing on how the code works.  
   - **Grey-box testing**: Combines both, testing with partial knowledge of the system.

8. **Is automation testing useful in Agile methodology?**  
   - Yes, automation helps achieve maximum test coverage in less time, supporting frequent releases.

9. **What is the difference between a test scenario, test case, and test script?**  
   - **Test Scenario**: Covers an end-to-end feature.  
   - **Test Case**: Describes specific test conditions and expected results.  
   - **Test Script**: A set of instructions executed for automated testing.

10. **What is a bug?**  
    - A bug is a software defect recorded in a bug-tracking system and assigned a priority before being fixed and retested.

11. **What is the difference between a bug and an error?**  
    - **Bug**: Found by testers and occurs when software behavior deviates from expected results.  
    - **Error**: Occurs when the code fails to compile or execute correctly.

12. **What is a test plan?**  
    - A dynamic document describing the testing scope, objectives, strategy, and resource planning.

13. **What is a test report?**  
    - A summary document detailing test execution, objectives, and results.

14. **What do you mean by test deliverables?**  
    - A list of documents, tools, and components shared with stakeholders at different phases of testing.

15. **What is A/B testing?**  
    - A method of testing two different versions of software with users to determine which performs better.

16. **What is boundary value analysis (BVA)?**  
    - A technique where test cases are created using boundary values, as they have a higher probability of defects.

17. **Why shouldn’t developers test their own software?**  
    - Developers may be biased, lack detailed test cases, and focus on making the code work rather than breaking it.

18. **What is the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)?**  
    - **Requirement Analysis**  
    - **Test Planning**  
    - **Test Case Development**  
    - **Test Environment Setup**  
    - **Test Execution**  
    - **Test Closure**  

19. **What is alpha testing?**  
    - Internal testing conducted before software is released to customers.

20. **What is beta testing?**  
    - Testing performed by customers after release, providing final feedback.

21. **What is the V-Model in software testing?**  
    - A development model where each testing phase is associated with a corresponding development phase.

22. **What is the defect life cycle?**  
    - The stages a defect goes through: **New → Assigned → Active → Tested → Verified → Closed**.

23. **What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)?**  
    - A methodology where developers first write failing tests, then implement code to make the tests pass.
