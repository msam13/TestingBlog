## Tools and Technologies in Software Testing

### Defect Management Tools
- Tools used to log, track, and manage defects.
- Ensure transparency, accountability, and communication among team members.

#### Key Features:
- Bug logging.
- Workflow management (customizable workflows).
- Advanced search and filter (e.g., Jira Query Language).
- CI/CD integration (automatically create bugs for failed test automation).
- Reporting and dashboards.

#### Types of Tickets:
- **Story/Epic**
- **Task**
- **Bug**

---

### Version Control
- Version control systems help developers manage changes to code.
- Useful in collaborative environments where multiple individuals work together, enabling tracking changes and reverting to previous versions if needed.

#### Key Terminologies:
- **Repository**: The project folder.
- **Branch**: A separate line of development.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to a repository.
- **Merge**: Combines changes from one branch to another.
- **Conflict**: Occurs when changes in two branches affect the same line of code.

#### Centralized vs Distributed Version Control Systems:
- **Centralized (CVCS)**: All versions of the project are stored on a central server. Users check out files, edit, and check them back in.
- **Distributed (DVCS)**: Each developer has an individual copy of the code. Developers work locally and share changes when needed to merge.

---

### CI/CD Tools
- Tools for continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD).
- Automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.

#### Example: Jenkins
- **Open-Source Automation Tool**: Used for building, testing, and deploying applications.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Pipeline**: A series of automated steps (written in Groovy).
  - **Plugins**: Extend functionality (e.g., GitHub, Docker).
  - **Job**: A task in Jenkins.

#### Jenkins Pipeline Workflow:
1. **Commit**: Developer commits code to GitHub.
2. **Trigger**: Jenkins detects the commit via webhooks.
3. **Build**: Jenkins pulls the code and builds it.
4. **Test**: Jenkins runs the test cases.
5. **Deploy**: If tests pass, the build is deployed to the specified environment.

### Performance Testing Tools
- Tools like **JMeter**, **LoadRunner**, and **k6** are used for load and stress testing to ensure application performance under various conditions.

---

### API Testing Tools
- Tools like **Postman**, **Newman**, and **REST Assured** are used for testing API endpoints to ensure they function as expected.

---

### Security Testing Tools
- Tools like **OWASP ZAP** and **Burp Suite**, as well as manual techniques, are used to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF.
