## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

SDLC defines the process of planning, designing, developing, testing, and deploying software.

### Stages of SDLC

1. **Requirement Analysis**  
   - Understand user requirements, both functional and non-functional.  
   - Create the **Requirement Specification Report (RSR)** document.

2. **Planning**  
   - Analyze requirements and decide the scope, timeline, cost, and resource estimation.  
   - Choose the appropriate SDLC model (**Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, V-Model**).

3. **Designing**  
   - **High-Level Design (HLD)**: Define system architecture, database structure, and UI/UX design.  
   - **Low-Level Design (LLD)**: Define classes, methods, and internal logic.

4. **Development**  
   - Develop software features using the selected programming language.  
   - Write **unit test cases** for individual components.

5. **Testing**  
   - Ensure the developed software satisfies functional and non-functional requirements.

6. **Deployment**  
   - Deploy the software into **staging/production environments**.

7. **Maintenance and Support**  
   - Release updates and patches.  
   - Fix any **bugs** if they arise.

## Models of SDLC

Choosing an SDLC model depends on factors like project complexity, size, available resources, client requirements, and risks.

1. **Waterfall Model**  
   - A sequential model where each stage follows the previous one.  
   - Best for small projects with well-defined requirements.

2. **V-Model**  
   - Similar to the Waterfall model but includes a testing phase for each development phase.  
   - Best for high-risk projects.

3. **Incremental Model**  
   - Software is built and delivered in increments.  
   - Best for medium and large projects requiring phased delivery.

4. **Agile Model**  
   - An iterative and incremental approach with continuous feedback.  
   - Best for medium and large projects with changing requirements.  
   - Requires planning and active customer involvement.

5. **Spiral Model**  
   - An iterative model with a focus on risk analysis.  
   - Stages: **Planning → Risk Analysis → Engineering → Evaluation** (repeated in spirals).  
   - Used for complex workflows.

6. **RAD Model (Rapid Application Development)**  
   - Minimal planning.  
   - Each functionality is divided and developed as parallel prototypes, which are later integrated.

## Agile Methodologies

Agile is an iterative, incremental approach to software development that adapts to changing requirements. Scrum and Kanban are two popular frameworks in Agile.

---

### Scrum and Kanban Frameworks

#### Scrum
- Used to manage complex projects.
- Focuses on delivering features in small, time-boxed intervals called **sprints** (2-4 weeks).

##### Key Components:
- **Roles**:
  - Product Owner
  - Scrum Master
  - Development Team
- **Events**:
  - Sprint Planning
  - Daily Stand-ups
  - Sprint Review
  - Sprint Retrospective
- **Artifacts**:
  - Product Backlog: A prioritized list of all features, bugs, and enhancements.
  - Sprint Backlog: Tasks to be completed within a sprint.
  - Increment: Shippable features completed in the sprint.

#### Kanban
- Focuses on **visualization** and the **flow of work**.
- Encourages continuous delivery without fixed time intervals.
- Ideal for teams with unpredictable workloads.

##### Key Features:
- **Visualization**: Kanban board with columns (e.g., To-Do, In-Progress, Done).
- **Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits**: Set a limit on tasks per column to avoid bottlenecks.
- Focuses on **workflow** rather than time-boxing.

| **Aspect**       | **Scrum**                                   | **Kanban**                                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Roles            | Fixed roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team) | No assigned roles                              |
| Iteration        | 2-4 weeks                                   | Continuous delivery                            |
| Planning         | Requires detailed planning                  | Minimal planning                               |
| Focus            | Sprint backlog                              | Entire workflow                                |
| Best For         | Teams with clear goals and timelines        | Teams with dynamic workloads and ongoing tasks |

### Writing and Testing User Stories

#### User Story
A **user story** is a short, simple description of a feature or functionality from the perspective of the end user.

**Format**:
```
    As a [type of user], I want to [goal or task], so that I can [benefit or value].
```

#### Characteristics of a Good User Story:
- **Independent**: Can be completed without dependencies on other stories.
- **Small**: Can be completed within a sprint.
- **Testable**: Acceptance criteria can be verified.
- **Value-Adding**: Provides value to the end user.
- **Estimatable**: Can be estimated in terms of effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria
Defines the conditions to mark the user story as complete.

**Example**:

```
Scenario 1: Adding a product to the cart Given: I am on the product page When: I click "Add to Cart" Then: The product is added to the cart, and a confirmation message is displayed.

Scenario 2: Viewing products in the cart Given: The cart contains products When: I click "View Cart" Then: The products in the cart should be displayed.

```

### Sprint Planning, Retrospectives, and Daily Stand-Ups

#### Sprint Planning
- A meeting held at the start of a sprint to decide the sprint backlog.
1. **Prioritize Tasks**: Product Owner identifies the highest-priority items.
2. **Task Breakdown**: The development team breaks down tasks into smaller units.
3. **Effort Estimation**: Use story points to estimate effort.
4. **Sprint Backlog**: Finalize tasks to be completed during the sprint.

#### Daily Stand-Ups
- A short meeting (≤15 minutes) to enhance team collaboration.
- Focuses on:
  - **What you did yesterday.**
  - **What you will do today.**
  - **Any blockers or issues.**

#### Retrospectives
- Conducted at the end of a sprint to reflect and improve.
- Discuss:
  - What went well.
  - What didn’t go well.
  - Areas for improvement.
- Decide actionable steps for what to **start**, **stop**, and **continue**.

    3. What do you mean by refactoring ?
        1. Refactoring is changing the internal structure of software without changing the external behavior. It is normally done to maintain the code. Red-Green refactor is a popular refactoring technique.
    4. What is the difference between sprint backlog and product backlog?
        1. sprint backlog - is the list of task the project development team plans to complete in a sprint. It is developed by and for the developers

        1. Daily Stand up meeting is a day-to-day meeting, where all team members discuss their progress, what was done yesterday, what is the plan for day and discuss any blockers. It brings everyone up to date on the information.
    10. What is incremental and iterative development ?
        1. Incremental - break up a project into chunks and complete the chunks individually. (monalisa in blocks)
        2. iterative - Build up features gradually (monalisa - outline, colors) in development cycles until the product is obtained.
