## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

SDLC defines the process of planning, designing, developing, testing, and deploying software.

### Stages of SDLC

1. **Requirement Analysis**  
   - Understand user requirements, both functional and non-functional.  
   - Create the **Requirement Specification Report (RSR)** document.

2. **Planning**  
   - Analyze requirements and decide the scope, timeline, cost, and resource estimation.  
   - Choose the appropriate SDLC model (**Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, V-Model**).

3. **Designing**  
   - **High-Level Design (HLD)**: Define system architecture, database structure, and UI/UX design.  
   - **Low-Level Design (LLD)**: Define classes, methods, and internal logic.

4. **Development**  
   - Develop software features using the selected programming language.  
   - Write **unit test cases** for individual components.

5. **Testing**  
   - Ensure the developed software satisfies functional and non-functional requirements.

6. **Deployment**  
   - Deploy the software into **staging/production environments**.

7. **Maintenance and Support**  
   - Release updates and patches.  
   - Fix any **bugs** if they arise.

## Models of SDLC

Choosing an SDLC model depends on factors like project complexity, size, available resources, client requirements, and risks.

1. **Waterfall Model**  
   - A sequential model where each stage follows the previous one.  
   - Best for small projects with well-defined requirements.

2. **V-Model**  
   - Similar to the Waterfall model but includes a testing phase for each development phase.  
   - Best for high-risk projects.

3. **Incremental Model**  
   - Software is built and delivered in increments.  
   - Best for medium and large projects requiring phased delivery.

4. **Agile Model**  
   - An iterative and incremental approach with continuous feedback.  
   - Best for medium and large projects with changing requirements.  
   - Requires planning and active customer involvement.

5. **Spiral Model**  
   - An iterative model with a focus on risk analysis.  
   - Stages: **Planning → Risk Analysis → Engineering → Evaluation** (repeated in spirals).  
   - Used for complex workflows.

6. **RAD Model (Rapid Application Development)**  
   - Minimal planning.  
   - Each functionality is divided and developed as parallel prototypes, which are later integrated.

## Agile Methodologies

Agile is an iterative, incremental approach to software development that adapts to changing requirements. Scrum and Kanban are two popular frameworks in Agile.

### Scrum and Kanban Frameworks

#### Scrum
- Used to manage complex projects.
- Focuses on delivering features in small, time-boxed intervals called **sprints** (2-4 weeks).

##### Key Components:
- **Roles**:
  - Product Owner
  - Scrum Master
  - Development Team
- **Events**:
  - Sprint Planning
  - Daily Stand-ups
  - Sprint Review
  - Sprint Retrospective
- **Artifacts**:
  - Product Backlog: A prioritized list of all features, bugs, and enhancements.
  - Sprint Backlog: Tasks to be completed within a sprint.
  - Increment: Shippable features completed in the sprint.

#### Kanban
- Focuses on **visualization** and the **flow of work**.
- Encourages continuous delivery without fixed time intervals.
- Ideal for teams with unpredictable workloads.

##### Key Features:
- **Visualization**: Kanban board with columns (e.g., To-Do, In-Progress, Done).
- **Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits**: Set a limit on tasks per column to avoid bottlenecks.
- Focuses on **workflow** rather than time-boxing.

| **Aspect**       | **Scrum**                                   | **Kanban**                                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Roles            | Fixed roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team) | No assigned roles                              |
| Iteration        | 2-4 weeks                                   | Continuous delivery                            |
| Planning         | Requires detailed planning                  | Minimal planning                               |
| Focus            | Sprint backlog                              | Entire workflow                                |
| Best For         | Teams with clear goals and timelines        | Teams with dynamic workloads and ongoing tasks |

### Writing and Testing User Stories

#### User Story
A **user story** is a short, simple description of a feature or functionality from the perspective of the end user.

**Format**:
```
    As a [type of user], I want to [goal or task], so that I can [benefit or value].
```

#### Characteristics of a Good User Story:
- **Independent**: Can be completed without dependencies on other stories.
- **Small**: Can be completed within a sprint.
- **Testable**: Acceptance criteria can be verified.
- **Value-Adding**: Provides value to the end user.
- **Estimatable**: Can be estimated in terms of effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria
Defines the conditions to mark the user story as complete.

**Example**:

```
Scenario 1: Adding a product to the cart Given: I am on the product page When: I click "Add to Cart" Then: The product is added to the cart, and a confirmation message is displayed.

Scenario 2: Viewing products in the cart Given: The cart contains products When: I click "View Cart" Then: The products in the cart should be displayed.

```

### Sprint Planning, Retrospectives, and Daily Stand-Ups

#### Sprint Planning
- A meeting held at the start of a sprint to decide the sprint backlog.
1. **Prioritize Tasks**: Product Owner identifies the highest-priority items.
2. **Task Breakdown**: The development team breaks down tasks into smaller units.
3. **Effort Estimation**: Use story points to estimate effort.
4. **Sprint Backlog**: Finalize tasks to be completed during the sprint.

#### Daily Stand-Ups
- A short meeting (≤15 minutes) to enhance team collaboration.
- Focuses on:
  - **What you did yesterday.**
  - **What you will do today.**
  - **Any blockers or issues.**

#### Retrospectives
- Conducted at the end of a sprint to reflect and improve.
- Discuss:
  - What went well.
  - What didn’t go well.
  - Areas for improvement.
- Decide actionable steps for what to **start**, **stop**, and **continue**.
