## Agile Methodologies

Agile is an iterative, incremental approach to software development that adapts to changing requirements. Scrum and Kanban are two popular frameworks in Agile.

### Scrum and Kanban Frameworks

#### Scrum
- Used to manage complex projects.
- Focuses on delivering features in small, time-boxed intervals called **sprints** (2-4 weeks).

##### Key Components:
- **Roles**:
  - Product Owner
  - Scrum Master
  - Development Team
- **Events**:
  - Sprint Planning
  - Daily Stand-ups
  - Sprint Review
  - Sprint Retrospective
- **Artifacts**:
  - Product Backlog: A prioritized list of all features, bugs, and enhancements.
  - Sprint Backlog: Tasks to be completed within a sprint.
  - Increment: Shippable features completed in the sprint.

#### Kanban
- Focuses on **visualization** and the **flow of work**.
- Encourages continuous delivery without fixed time intervals.
- Ideal for teams with unpredictable workloads.

##### Key Features:
- **Visualization**: Kanban board with columns (e.g., To-Do, In-Progress, Done).
- **Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits**: Set a limit on tasks per column to avoid bottlenecks.
- Focuses on **workflow** rather than time-boxing.

| **Aspect**       | **Scrum**                                   | **Kanban**                                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Roles            | Fixed roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team) | No assigned roles                              |
| Iteration        | 2-4 weeks                                   | Continuous delivery                            |
| Planning         | Requires detailed planning                  | Minimal planning                               |
| Focus            | Sprint backlog                              | Entire workflow                                |
| Best For         | Teams with clear goals and timelines        | Teams with dynamic workloads and ongoing tasks |

### Writing and Testing User Stories

#### User Story
A **user story** is a short, simple description of a feature or functionality from the perspective of the end user.

**Format**:
```
    As a [type of user], I want to [goal or task], so that I can [benefit or value].
```

#### Characteristics of a Good User Story:
- **Independent**: Can be completed without dependencies on other stories.
- **Small**: Can be completed within a sprint.
- **Testable**: Acceptance criteria can be verified.
- **Value-Adding**: Provides value to the end user.
- **Estimatable**: Can be estimated in terms of effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria
Defines the conditions to mark the user story as complete.

**Example**:

```
Scenario 1: Adding a product to the cart Given: I am on the product page When: I click "Add to Cart" Then: The product is added to the cart, and a confirmation message is displayed.

Scenario 2: Viewing products in the cart Given: The cart contains products When: I click "View Cart" Then: The products in the cart should be displayed.

```

### Sprint Planning, Retrospectives, and Daily Stand-Ups

#### Sprint Planning
- A meeting held at the start of a sprint to decide the sprint backlog.
1. **Prioritize Tasks**: Product Owner identifies the highest-priority items.
2. **Task Breakdown**: The development team breaks down tasks into smaller units.
3. **Effort Estimation**: Use story points to estimate effort.
4. **Sprint Backlog**: Finalize tasks to be completed during the sprint.

#### Daily Stand-Ups
- A short meeting (≤15 minutes) to enhance team collaboration.
- Focuses on:
  - **What you did yesterday.**
  - **What you will do today.**
  - **Any blockers or issues.**

#### Retrospectives
- Conducted at the end of a sprint to reflect and improve.
- Discuss:
  - What went well.
  - What didn’t go well.
  - Areas for improvement.
- Decide actionable steps for what to **start**, **stop**, and **continue**.
