## Web Application Testing

### Frontend Testing

#### Verifying UI/UX Elements
- UI/UX refers to the **User Interface** and **User Experience**.
- Test the visual and functional aspects of UI elements like buttons, text, dropdown lists, and toggle buttons.
- Verify behavior, such as:
  - Button clicks
  - Hover effects
  - Tooltips
  - Animations
- **Tools**: Applitools (AI-based visual testing tool)

#### Responsiveness and Cross-Browser Testing
- Ensure the application adapts and performs on devices with different screen sizes and resolutions.
- Validate:
  - Hamburger icon display on small screens
  - Proper text wrapping
  - No overlapping elements
  - Correct element alignment
  - Touch interactions on mobile devices
- **Tools**: Browser developer tools, LambdaTest, Sauce Labs

#### Validating CSS, HTML, and JavaScript Functionality
- Verify that the frontend technologies are implemented correctly and functioning as expected.

### Backend Testing

#### API Testing
- Use tools like **Postman**, **Swagger**, or **REST Assured** to validate API endpoints.

#### Database Testing
- Test database queries, constraints, and relationships to ensure data integrity.

#### Server-Side Validation
- Verify that the backend performs proper validation for all user inputs.

### Web-Specific Tests

#### Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Ensure consistent application behavior across various browsers and versions.
- **Tools**: LambdaTest, BrowserStack
- **What to test**:
  - UI elements
  - Styling
  - JavaScript behavior
  - Third-party integrations (e.g., payment gateways)

#### Cross-Device Compatibility
- Test on different devices like mobile, tablet, and desktop to ensure proper functionality.

#### Web Performance Testing
- **Load Times**: Verify the website loads in under 2 seconds.
  - **Tool**: Google Lighthouse
- **Latency**: Test network latency and server response time.
  - **Tools**: CDN tools, LoadRunner
- **Resource Utilization**:
  - Measure how efficiently CPU, memory, and bandwidth are utilized during peak usage.
  - Keep peak resource utilization under 80%.
  - **Tools**: Chrome DevTools, AWS CloudWatch, Dynatrace

### Security Testing

#### SQL Injection
- **SQL Injection**: Malicious SQL commands are injected into input fields to delete or modify the database.
  - **Tools**: Burp Suite, SQLMap

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** occurs when malicious input is injected into a website and executed on the client side.
  - **Types**:
    - Stored: Malicious code is stored on the server (e.g., in comments).
    - Reflected: Malicious code is reflected from the server (e.g., in query parameters).
    - DOM-Based: Attack occurs directly in the DOM.
  - **Tool**: Burp Suite
  - **Example**: Inject `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If an alert pops up, the application is vulnerable.

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **CSRF**: Unauthorized actions are performed on behalf of an authenticated user.
  - **Tool**: Burp Suite

### Performance Testing

#### Load Testing
- Simulate a specified number of users to verify application functionality under expected traffic.

#### Stress Testing
- Simulate traffic beyond the expected load to find the application's breakpoint.

#### Scalability Testing
- Test the application's ability to scale up or down depending on the load.

#### Endurance Testing
- Test the application under load for an extended period to check for memory leaks or performance degradation.
