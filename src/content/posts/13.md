# Git Overview

## What is Git?
**Git** is a **distributed version control system** that helps developers track and manage changes in their source code efficiently. It is widely used for **collaboration** in software projects.

### Why Use Git?
- Allows multiple developers to **work simultaneously** on a project.
- Tracks changes and **reverts to previous versions** if needed.
- Supports **branching** for feature development without affecting the main codebase.
- Enables easy collaboration using **remote repositories** like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

### Key Git Concepts
- **Repository (Repo)**: A folder containing a project's code and its version history.
- **Commit**: A saved snapshot of code changes.
- **Branch**: A separate line of development for features or fixes.
- **Merge**: Combines changes from one branch into another.
- **Rebase**: Moves commits from one branch to another to maintain a linear history.
- **Staging Area**: Where changes are prepared before committing.
- **Remote Repository**: A Git repo hosted on a cloud service.
- **Local Repository**: A Git repo stored on your local system.

# Setting Up Git

### Configure Git
```bash
git config --global user.name "Samridha"
git config --global user.email "m@m.com"

# Git Commands Cheat Sheet

## Create a Repository
```bash
git init  # Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory
```

## Clone a Repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>  # Clones a repository from a remote source
```

## Check Status of Changes
```bash
git status  # Shows the status of staged, unstaged, and untracked files
```

## View Commit History
```bash
git log  # Displays commit history
```

## Push Changes to Remote Repository
```bash
git push origin <branch_name>  # Pushes local changes to a remote branch
```

## Pull Latest Changes from Remote Repository
```bash
git pull origin <branch_name>  # Fetches and merges updates from the remote branch
```

## Working with Branches

### Create and Switch to a New Branch
```bash
git branch <branch-name>  # Creates a new branch
git checkout <branch-name>  # Switches to the specified branch
```

### Merge Branches
```bash
git checkout main  # Switch to the main branch
git merge <branch-name>  # Merges the specified branch into the main branch
```

## Undoing Changes in a Branch

### Revert a Commit
```bash
git revert <commit-id>  # Creates a new commit that reverts the specified commit
```

### Reset a Commit (DANGEROUS)
```bash
git reset --hard <commit-id>  # Resets branch history to the specified commit
```

## Saving and Restoring Uncommitted Work

### Stash Changes
```bash
git stash  # Temporarily saves changes that are not ready for commit
```

### Apply Stashed Changes
```bash
git stash pop  # Restores the most recent stashed changes
```

## Rebase vs. Merge

### Merge
- Combines changes from another branch and creates a **new commit**.

### Rebase
- Moves the commits from one branch **on top of another**, making the history linear.

```bash
git checkout main  # Switch to main branch
git rebase feature-branch  # Apply feature branch commits on top of main branch
```

# Git Overview

## What is Git?
**Git** is a **version control system** used for tracking changes in source code. It helps developers collaborate efficiently and manage code history.

### Why Use Git?
- Tracks and manages changes to code.
- Facilitates team collaboration in software development.
- Supports branching for feature development.
- Allows reverting to previous code versions if needed.

### Common Git Terminology
- **git add** - Adds the latest changes to staging before committing.
- **git commit** - Stores a snapshot of the staged changes.
- **git push** - Pushes local commits to the remote repository.
- **git branch** - Creates a parallel version of the repository.
- **git clone** - Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
- **repo (repository)** - A project folder managed by Git.
- **git merge** - Combines changes from one branch into another.
- **conflict** - Occurs when two branches modify the same line of code.
- **git rebase** - Moves commits from one branch to another to maintain a linear history.
- **remote repository** - A Git repository hosted on a cloud service (e.g., GitHub).
- **local repository** - A Git repository stored on your local system.
- **HEAD** - A pointer to the latest commit in the current branch.

# Git Interview Q&A

### 1. What is the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`?
| **Command** | **Description** |
|------------|---------------|
| `git fetch` | Downloads changes from the remote repository but does **not** merge them. |
| `git pull` | Fetches and **automatically merges** the changes into your local branch. |

**Example:**
```bash
git fetch origin
git diff main origin/main  # Compare local and remote versions
git merge  # Manually merge changes
```

---

### 2. What is commit squashing?
- **Squashing** combines multiple commits into a single commit to keep history clean.
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~4  # Squash the last 4 commits
```

---

### 3. What does a force push do?
- A **force push** (`git push origin main --force`) overwrites the remote branch with your local branch.

---

### 4. How do you rename a branch?
```bash
git branch -m <old-name> <new-name>
```

---

### 5. What is Git Cherry Pick?
- **Cherry-picking** allows applying a specific commit from one branch to another **without merging the entire branch**.
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-id>
```

---

### 6. How would you find a specific commit?
```bash
git log --grep "commit message"
```

---

### 7. How to start an interactive rebase?
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~4  # Rebase the last 4 commits interactively
```

---

### 8. How do you reset the last commit?
| **Scenario** | **Command** |
|-------------|------------|
| **Before pushing** | `git reset --soft HEAD~1` (Keeps changes unstaged) |
| **After pushing** | `git revert HEAD` (Creates a new commit to undo the last commit) |

---

### 9. How does `git revert` work?
- `git revert` creates a **new commit** that undoes the last commit without modifying history.

---

### 10. Difference between Git and SVN?
| **Aspect** | **Git** | **SVN** |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Architecture** | Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) | Centralized Version Control System (CVCS) |
| **Offline Work** | Can commit changes offline | Requires network access |
| **Branching** | Lightweight and fast | Heavyweight and slow |
| **Merging** | Easier and supports rebase | Complex and less flexible |

---

## Summary
- **Git** is a powerful **distributed version control system**.
- It supports **branching, merging, and collaboration** across teams.
- Commands like `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and `git pull` are essential for daily workflows.
- **Understanding rebase, cherry-picking, and interactive rebasing** helps in managing cleaner histories.
- **Git interview questions** often focus on version control concepts and best practices.
