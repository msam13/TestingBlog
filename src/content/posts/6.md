## Web Development Basics

### HTTP/HTTPS Protocol
- **Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** and **HTTP Secure (HTTPS)** are protocols used for communication between clients and servers on the web.
- **HTTPS** adds an extra layer of security by encrypting communication using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security).

#### Request and Response Structure:
- **Request**:
  - Contains method, URL, headers, and an optional body.
- **Response**:
  - Includes status code, headers, and an optional body.

#### Common HTTP Methods:
- **GET**: Fetch data from the server.
- **POST**: Send data to the server to create a resource.
- **PUT**: Update an existing resource on the server.
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server.

#### Status Codes:
- **2xx: Success**
  - Example: `200 OK`, `201 Created`, `204 No Content`.
- **3xx: Redirection**
  - Example: `301 Moved Permanently`, `302 Found`, `304 Not Modified`.
- **4xx: Client Error**
  - Example: `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`, `429 Too Many Requests`.
- **5xx: Server Error**
  - Example: `500 Internal Server Error`, `502 Bad Gateway`, `503 Service Unavailable`, `504 Gateway Timeout`.

  ### HTTP Status Codes

    | **Code** | **Message**           | **Description**                                                               |
    |----------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | 200      | OK                    | Request was successful and response contains requested data.                 |
    | 201      | Created               | New data was created after a POST request.                                   |
    | 204      | No Content            | Request was successful, but no content to return (e.g., after a DELETE request). |
    | 301      | Moved Permanently     | Requested resource has been permanently moved to a different URL.            |
    | 302      | Found                 | Requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URL.            |
    | 304      | Not Modified          | Resource has not been modified since the last request.                       |
    | 400      | Bad Request           | The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.           |
    | 401      | Unauthorized          | Authentication is required but was not provided or is invalid.               |
    | 403      | Forbidden             | Client understands the request but refuses to authorize it.                  |
    | 404      | Not Found             | The requested resource could not be found on the server.                     |
    | 405      | Method Not Allowed    | The request method is not supported for the requested resource.              |
    | 429      | Too Many Requests     | Client has sent too many requests in a short time (rate limiting).           |
    | 500      | Internal Server Error | The server encountered an unexpected condition.                              |
    | 502      | Bad Gateway           | The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.             |
    | 503      | Service Unavailable   | The server is temporarily unable to handle requests (e.g., maintenance).     |
    | 504      | Gateway Timeout       | The server did not receive a timely response from an upstream server.        |

### REST and GraphQL APIs
- **REST (Representational State Transfer)**:
  - A design standard for web APIs that uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
  - Resources are represented as URLs (e.g., `/users`).
  - Responses are typically in JSON format.
- **GraphQL**:
  - A flexible API query language that allows clients to request specific data in a single query.
  - Ideal for modern applications with complex data requirements.

### Web Architecture

#### Client-Server Model:
- **Client**: Sends requests and displays responses.
- **Server**: Processes requests and sends back responses.

#### Single-Page Applications (SPAs):
- Load a single HTML file and update content dynamically without reloading the page.
- Examples: Gmail, Trello.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduced server load after the initial page load.
  - Fast and responsive user experience.

#### Microservices:
- Applications are divided into small, independent services that perform specific functionalities and communicate via APIs.
- **Advantages**:
  - Scalability: Services can scale independently.
  - Fault Isolation: Issues in one service do not affect the others.

#### Cloud-Hosted Applications:
- Applications are deployed on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
- **Advantages**:
  - Scalability: Easily scale resources based on demand.
  - Monitoring: Built-in tools for performance monitoring.
  - High Availability: Redundancy and failover capabilities.
