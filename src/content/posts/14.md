# Advanced Software Testing Book

## Risk-Based Testing

**Risk-based testing** is a test strategy that prioritizes test cases based on the likelihood and impact of potential failures.

- More focus should be given to areas with high risk.
- Resources should be appropriately allocated.

### Where Does Risk Come From?
- Complex features
- Frequently used features
- Past defect history

### How to Assess Risk?
- Based on likelihood and impact
- Create a **Likelihood-Impact Matrix**
- **Risk Matrix:**

| Likelihood → | Low Impact | Medium Impact | High Impact |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Low**     | Low       | Low          | Medium     |
| **Medium**  | Low       | Medium       | High       |
| **High**    | Medium    | High         | Critical   |

### Testing Strategy Based on Risk Level
- **High Risk** → Extensive testing (functional, edge cases, performance, security).
- **Medium Risk** → Moderate testing (positive and negative test cases).
- **Low Risk** → Minimal testing (smoke and sanity checks).

### Pragmatic Risk-Based Testing
- Use scoring:
  - **Low** = 1
  - **Medium** = 2
  - **High** = 3
- **Risk Score** = Impact Score × Likelihood Score

### How to Determine Likelihood Score?
- Recent code changes
- History of defects
- Code complexity (Git changes)
- Usage frequency
- Integration with third-party tools
- Security vulnerabilities

### Tools for Risk Assessment
- **SonarQube**, **Pylint**

## Structure-Based Testing

**Structure-based testing** is a **white-box testing** strategy where test cases are defined based on the internal structure of the code rather than just relying on external behavior.

### Why Structure-Based Testing?
- Helps uncover defects not found in **black-box testing**.
- Identifies **dead code** (unused or unreachable code).
- Detects **missing conditions** and **logical errors**.
- Ensures **better test coverage**.

### Types of Structure-Based Testing

1. **Statement Coverage** – Ensures all statements in the code are executed.
2. **Branch Coverage** – Ensures all decision branches are executed.
3. **Path Coverage** – Ensures all execution paths are tested.
   - Use **flow graphs** to determine possible paths.
   - Design test cases for each path.
   - **Cyclomatic Complexity** – Measures the number of independent paths in a program.
4. **Loop Coverage** – Ensures loops are tested with:
   - 0 iterations (loop not executed)
   - 1 iteration (loop executed once)
   - Multiple iterations

### Tools for Code Coverage Measurement
- **SonarQube**, **Pylint**

### Automation Strategy
- Automate **all unit test cases**.

### Selecting the Right Structure-Based Coverage
| System Complexity | Recommended Coverage |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Simple System   | **Statement Coverage** is sufficient |
| Complex System  | **Path Coverage** is required |

## Analytical Techniques

**Analytical techniques** involve analyzing code to **improve quality** and **detect defects early**.

### Static Analysis

In **static analysis**, code is examined **without executing it**. It helps identify issues related to **structure, control flow, and data flow**.

#### 1. Control Flow Analysis
- Uses **control flow graphs** to identify:
  - Unreachable code
  - Infinite loops
  - Paths that are not tested

#### 2. Data Flow Analysis
- Tracks **variable value changes** throughout the program.
- Helps detect:
  - Uninitialized variables
  - Unused variables
  - Incorrect assignments

#### 3. Call Graph Analysis
- Constructs a **graph of function calls** within the program.
- Helps detect:
  - Excessive dependencies
  - Low modularity
  - **Used in integration testing**

---

### Dynamic Analysis

**Dynamic analysis** involves executing the program to **detect runtime issues** such as crashes, memory leaks, and pointer-related errors.

#### 1. Memory Leaks
- Occurs when memory is allocated but **not freed**.
- Leads to:
  - **Performance degradation**
  - **Crashes due to high memory consumption**

#### 2. Wild Pointers
- A **wild pointer** is an **uninitialized pointer**.
- Can cause **segmentation faults and crashes**.
