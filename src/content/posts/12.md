# Operating System Basics

## What is an Operating System?
An **Operating System (OS)** is **system software** that manages hardware and software resources while providing common services for computer programs. It acts as an interface between users and computer hardware.

### Key Responsibilities of an OS:
1. **Process Management** – Handles process scheduling, execution, and resource allocation.
2. **Memory Management** – Allocates and deallocates memory to processes.
3. **File System Management** – Manages data storage, retrieval, and organization.
4. **Device Management** – Controls communication between hardware devices and software.
5. **Security and Access Control** – Protects data and system integrity.
6. **User Interface (UI)** – Provides CLI (Command Line Interface) or GUI (Graphical User Interface).

### Types of Operating Systems:
1. **Real-Time OS (RTOS)** – Designed for real-time applications (e.g., FreeRTOS).
2. **Distributed OS** – Runs on multiple machines to provide high availability.
3. **Multiprogramming OS** – Allows multiple programs to execute simultaneously.
4. **Batch OS** – Executes batches of jobs with minimal user interaction.
5. **Time-Sharing OS** – Provides multiple users access to a system simultaneously.

# Process Management

## What is a Process?
- A **process** is a **program loaded in memory** and currently executing.
- It consists of four main sections:
  - **Stack**: Stores function parameters, return addresses, and local variables.
  - **Heap**: Dynamically allocated memory (e.g., using `malloc` or `calloc`).
  - **Data**: Stores global variables.
  - **Text**: Contains compiled code, processor registers, and current execution state.

### Process States
A process goes through multiple states during execution:
1. **Start** – Process is created.
2. **Ready** – Process is waiting for CPU execution.
3. **Running** – Process is being executed.
4. **Waiting** – Process is waiting for I/O or other resources.
5. **Terminated** – Process has completed execution.

### Process Control Block (PCB)
- The **PCB** is a data structure maintained by the OS for each process.
- It stores essential information to track process execution.
- **Common PCB elements**:
  - Process State
  - Privileges
  - Program Counter
  - Register Information

## Process Scheduling
- **Process scheduling** is managed by the OS to determine which process executes at a given time.
- Scheduling falls into two categories:
  - **Preemptive**: The OS allocates CPU time for a fixed period before switching processes.
  - **Non-Preemptive**: A process runs until it completes or voluntarily releases CPU.

### Context Switching
- The mechanism of saving the current CPU state to PCB and restoring it when resuming the process.
- This is computationally expensive, so some systems have multiple CPU register sets to optimize switching.

### Scheduling Algorithms
1. **First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS)** – Processes are executed in the order they arrive.
2. **Shortest Job Next (SJN)** – The process with the shortest execution time runs first.
3. **Priority-Based Scheduling** – Processes are assigned priorities; highest priority runs first.
4. **Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)** – The process closest to completion gets priority but can be preempted.
5. **Round Robin (RR)** – Each process gets a fixed time slice before switching.
6. **Multilevel Queue Scheduling** – Multiple queues exist for different types of processes, each with its own scheduling algorithm.

# Memory Management

## What is Memory Management?
- Memory is the **primary storage** space where programs and data reside during execution.
- It is **fast but limited** compared to secondary storage.
- The OS is responsible for:
  - **Allocation**: Assigning memory to processes.
  - **Deallocation**: Reclaiming memory after processes complete.
  - **Fragmentation Management**: Handling scattered free memory using **paging** or **segmentation**.
  - **Protection**: Preventing unauthorized memory access to ensure system stability.

### Memory Management Techniques
Different systems use different techniques, or combinations of them:

1. **Contiguous Allocation**:
   - Memory is divided into fixed-size blocks and allocated sequentially.
   - **Issue**: Leads to **external fragmentation** (unused memory between allocations).

2. **Paging**:
   - Memory and processes are divided into fixed-size **pages**.
   - **Allows non-contiguous allocation** but may lead to **internal fragmentation** (unused memory within pages).

3. **Segmentation**:
   - Process is divided into logical **segments** (e.g., code, data, stack).
   - **Allows non-contiguous allocation**, reducing fragmentation.

4. **Virtual Memory and Demand Paging**:
   - Processes are **partially loaded into memory**, with additional parts loaded **on demand**.
   - Improves efficiency but may lead to **page faults** (frequent memory swaps).

# Process vs. Thread

| Aspect          | Process                                        | Thread                                  |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Definition     | A program in execution with its own memory space. | A lightweight process that shares memory with others. |
| Memory        | Has its own memory space.                      | Shares memory with other threads in the same process. |
| Communication  | Requires **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**. | Shares memory, enabling faster communication. |
| Overhead      | Higher (due to memory allocation, scheduling). | Lower (threads share system resources). |
| Execution     | Processes run independently.                   | Threads can run concurrently within a process. |
